            <p>Justus Sturkenboom is a lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam. He normally lectures us on very technical aspects of (Frontend) coding. This time he talked about sketchnoting.</p>
          <div class="columns">
            <p>Sketchnoting helps you with idea development and helps you to remember lectures better. The longer you do it the more you can add to your "visual vocabulary", this will make your sketchnoting faster and better.</p>

            <h3>Plan & research</h3>
            <p>Prior to attending a lecture find out what it's about, start thinking about which visuals you will need and update your "visual vocabulary" if necessary. When a lecture starts with a planning you can use it to organize your page so you'll have enough room.</p>

            <h3>Capture</h3>
            <p>During the lecture start capturing it by sketching. </p>

            <h3>Refine</h3>
            <p>You don't have to capture everything at once, you can finish your sketches later. Sketchnotes don't have to be very pretty, as long as you know what it means.</p>

            <h3>Repeat</h3>
            <p>The only way to get better at sketchnoting is repeating and practicing.</p>

            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <p>The right materials will help you on your way, use fineliners for the basis and highlight important things with a Promarker. Using a yellow Promarker can help with creativity. </p>

        <div class="blog">
            <p>Stephen Hay came to talk about his work as a frontend developer & designer. He is a Senior UX Designer at a Dutch online auction company, Catawiki.</p>
          <div class="columns">
            <p>Stephen is originally from California, U.S.A. and studied Graphic Design & Fine Arts. He is a big believer that the web should be accesible to everyone. He has contributed a lot to accessibility standards of the web as we know it by helping to create the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>

            <h3>WCAG</h3>
            <p>The WCAG are composed and published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and are part of their Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Five requirements have to be met before content can be classified as conforming to WCAG 2.0.</p>
            <h3>Principle 1 – Perceivable</h3>
            <p>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 1.1 - Text alternatives</h4>
            <p>Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 1.2 – Time-based Media</h4>
            <p>Provide alternatives for time-based media.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 1.3 – Adaptable</h4>
            <p>Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 1.4 – Distinguishable</h4>
            <p>Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.</p>

            <h3>Principle 2 – Operable</h3>
            <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 2.1 – Keyboard Accessible</h4>
            <p>Make all functionality available from a keyboard.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 2.2 – Enough Time</h4>
            <p>Provide users enough time to read and use content.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 2.3 – Seizures</h4>
            <p>Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 2.4 – Navigable</h4>
            <p>Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.</p>

            <h3>Principle 3 – Understandable</h3>
            <p>Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 3.1 – Readable</h4>
            <p>Make text content readable and understandable.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 3.2 – Predictable</h4>
            <p>Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 3.3 – Input Assistance</h4>
            <p>Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</p>

            <h3>Principle 4 – Robust</h3>
            <p>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>

            <h4>Guideline 4.1 – Compatible</h4>
            <p>Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
